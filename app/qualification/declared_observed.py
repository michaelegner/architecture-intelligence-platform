"""AIP v0.4.1 I1.1 - the single semantic owner for declared-vs-observed qualification
(docs/specifications/0.4.1/i1-qualification-consistency.md, spec sections cited inline below).

This module is deliberately dependency-free: it imports nothing from `neo4j`, FastAPI, MCP,
`app.architecture_intelligence.*`, or `app.analysis.runtime` (spec §8). `app.analysis.runtime`
imports *this* module in I1.2, so the reverse import would be circular - which is also why this
module never accepts a `ServiceTelemetryCoverage` object (owned by `app.analysis.runtime`), only
flat booleans.

Both the Cypher/analysis path (`app.analysis.runtime`) and the Architecture Intelligence/MCP path
(`app.architecture_intelligence.dependency_projection`) consume this module after I1.2 (ADR 0010).
The objective is one semantic rule, not layer convergence: each path keeps its own request shape
and destination-resolution/claim-construction responsibilities (spec §14/§16); only DECLARED/
OBSERVED evidence matching, environment/window matching, coverage classification, and the
qualification table live here.
