    Pairing happens in two phases. First, within this one decoded OTLP batch

    batch, against a caller-supplied HttpCorrelationBuffer (11H R2/spec §6) - a bounded, TTL-based,
    in-memory store of spans still awaiting their counterpart from a *different* /v1/traces POST.
    This supersedes H4's original single-batch-only limitation: real OTel Collector batch
    processors flush by time/size, not trace completeness, so a call's two sides frequently arrive
    in separate batches - the buffer (never a Neo4j Span store, never unbounded, spec
    §6.3/§13/§14) closes that gap while still never becoming the "trace store"/causality graph
    this platform deliberately stays out of. Passing correlation_buffer=None (the default) skips
    the second phase entirely, preserving exactly the original single-batch-only behavior -
    existing callers/tests are unaffected.

    Environment, method, route, and timestamp are always read from the SERVER span, not the
    client - this is necessary, not just a style choice: declared Operation ids are minted from
    the provider's own OpenAPI path, so sourcing the route from the client's url.template instead
    risks a lexical mismatch against the declared path string, silently breaking Fall A matching
    (H4.6). This holds identically whether the SERVER span was seen in-batch or arrived from the
    correlation buffer. source_service_version comes from the CLIENT span (the "source"/calling
    side) in both phases too.

    way).

    Classification keys exclusively off messaging.operation.type (spec §25/§26's own literal
    examples never mention span_kind, and messaging.operation.type exists in real OTel semantic
    conventions specifically because span_kind is too coarse to disambiguate "receive" from
    "process"). A span with no recognized operation.type is not a candidate observation at all and
    is silently skipped, not reported as unresolved - the same status as an INTERNAL-kind span in
    the HTTP path. This recognition surface is frozen (v0.4.1 I2 spec §21) - I2 only adds refusal
    paths after this point, never new recognition before it.

    v0.4.1 I2 (spec §6/§18/§22): the destination and service-identity guards both run, in that
    order, before any entity, Evidence, or fact is recorded for a span - neither guard is wired
    alone (spec §36), and no unsafe "mint anyway" path exists. A destination refusal is reported
    without ever resolving service identity (spec §6's destination-first precedence, so exactly one
    reason is produced when both would fail); a service refusal after a destination accept still
    records nothing - the accepted destination's resolution is discarded, not partially persisted.
