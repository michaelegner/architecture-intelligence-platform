"""v0.5.0 I4 internal, source-owned Pub/Sub carriers - never canonical entities, relations, or public
properties, and never snapshot inputs.

- `PubSubDeclaration` (I4 spec §11): "Every declared Pub/Sub artifact SHALL retain source
  instance/revision/locator/pointer, semantic digest, adapter/version, broker/namespace evidence,
  kind evidence, identity inputs, and mapping-rule identity/version." The Queue path records only one
  document-level `Provenance`; this per-(entity, source, pointer) node is where the per-artifact
  retention lives (a slice-2 design decision, disclosed in its PR), modeled on I2's
  `InfrastructureContribution`.
- `SubscriptionDeadLetterConfiguration` (I4 spec §10): the Subscription-scoped declared dead-letter
  target, retained as exact tokens only - no generic target entity or relation is ever minted from
  it.

Both are written by the importer with the same MERGE-with-`owner_source_ids` template as every
other canonical node, so they inherit the existing ownership/replay/expiry engine unchanged (§11:
"No parallel lifecycle engine is permitted"). Every field is a Neo4j-storable primitive or list.
