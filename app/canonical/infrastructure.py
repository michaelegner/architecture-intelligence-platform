"""I2 Draft 0.2 §7.1/§7.2's frozen infrastructure entity/contribution/claim schemas - the Canonical
Model's capacity to carry Kubernetes infrastructure facts (v0.5.0 I2's §3 prerequisite slice, item
6). No adapter populates these yet: that begins at I2 §12 slice 2 (envelope/identity) and slice 3
(the first real Kubernetes adapter). A separate module from `app.canonical.model`, mirroring how
`app.provenance.model` is already its own module - these are a distinct fact category
(infrastructure, not application) from Service/Operation/Queue/Message/Schema/Relation.

§7's invariants are enforced here rather than left to the eventual adapter's good behavior: an
adapter that emits an unsorted evidence list, a `WORKLOAD_EXISTS` claim with an object, or
Service-only fields on a Pod has a real bug, and this repo rejects rather than silently repairing
("unsupported > falsely supported"). Cross-entity referential integrity (do these ids actually
resolve?) belongs to `app.validation.canonical_validation`, which sees the whole merged model.

Field names and shapes here are this PR's own choice where the spec gives only a prose bullet list,
not a schema - §7.1 explicitly delegates this: "The exact Python classes, package layout, graph
labels, and persistence encoding are implementation decisions. They MUST preserve these logical
fields, contribution boundaries, and conflict outcomes."
