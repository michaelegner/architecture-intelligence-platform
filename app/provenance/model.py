# The source types a *public* evidence answer may carry. `app.architecture_intelligence.contracts`
# types the frozen v0.5 evidence schema's `source_type` from this enum.
#
# KUBERNETES and CONFIGURATION were added in v0.5.0 I3 (spec §16.1): I2 Draft 0.2 §9 kept ALL
# Kubernetes evidence off every public surface with no exception. I3 narrows that boundary rather
# than removing it - a Kubernetes/configuration-mapping evidence record becomes publicly reachable
# only when the current snapshot makes it reachable from a public DEPLOYED_AS claim or
# DeploymentResolution (I3 spec §16.2's exact reachability gate); every other Kubernetes evidence
# record remains exactly as internal as I2 left it. This enum widening reflects that a public
# payload CAN now carry these values under that gate - it does not itself relax the gate, which is
# enforced elsewhere (I3's reconciliation/exposure layer, not this type definition). The internal
# Kubernetes source-type value lives at `app.canonical.infrastructure.KUBERNETES_SOURCE_TYPE`; the
# configuration-mapping source type has no internal-module constant of its own yet since I3's
# mapping-artifact evidence lands in a later slice.
#
# Kept as a comment rather than a class docstring on purpose: Pydantic exports a model/enum
# docstring as the generated JSON Schema's `description`, so writing this as a docstring would
# itself change the frozen public schema (caught by tests/unit/test_architecture_intelligence_
# schema_frozen.py).
