"""v0.4.0 I2.1/I2.2/I2.3 - registers the two I2 tools for discovery (spec §9, §19's "deterministic
two-tool discovery") and gives both `get_service_dependencies` and `get_evidence` their real
dispatch bodies (spec §10, §11).

v0.4.0 I3.2 adds a third tool, `get_architecture_drift` (I3 spec §23), registered first so
`tools/list`'s now-three-tool discovery stays lexicographic (I3 spec §24). Its `ArchitectureDriftRequest`
carries the identical `observation_context` shape `ServiceDependenciesRequest` does (I3.1 pinned
this field-validation equivalence), so the pre-dispatch context check below is factored into
`_reject_malformed_observation_context` and shared by both tools rather than duplicated.

`register_tools` takes an explicit `MCPServer` rather than registering directly against the
module-level singleton, so tests can build an isolated server (and session manager) per test instead
of sharing `app.mcp.server.mcp_server`'s across an entire event loop/test run. It also takes an
explicit `get_service` callable (defaulting to `app.mcp.wiring.get_service`, the real lazy production
lookup - see that module's docstring for why the lookup must be lazy) for the same reason: a test
closes over its own real-or-stub `ArchitectureIntelligenceService` instead of mutating the shared
production wiring singleton. `get_service` is called once per `get_service_dependencies` dispatch,
never at registration time.

Each tool takes one `request` parameter typed as the real I1/I2 request model, so the SDK derives
`inputSchema` from that model's own (already frozen/tested) schema, nested under a `request` key
(confirmed live: the SDK always synthesizes a wrapper argument model for a function's parameters,
never uses a single `BaseModel`-typed parameter's schema directly) - `outputSchema`, by contrast, IS
used directly for a `BaseModel`-typed return value (confirmed live), so `structuredContent` is the
bare `ArchitectureAnswer` envelope per spec §10 rule 3. That wrapper argument model does not itself
declare `additionalProperties: false` (confirmed live - `mcp.server.mcpserver.utilities.func_metadata
.ArgModelBase` has no `extra="forbid"`), which would leave the *advertised* `inputSchema` open even
though `app.mcp.guard` already rejects an unexpected top-level argument key at runtime. Spec §9
requires a genuinely closed `inputSchema`, so `_close_input_schema` mutates each registered tool's
`Tool.parameters` (the dict `tools/list` serializes) after registration to match the behavior the
guard already enforces - the schema and the runtime agree either way; this makes the *advertised*
contract say so too.

        reimplementation, the same pure function, called once more for its side-effect-free
        `pydantic.ValidationError`. This is deliberate, not redundant: a first review round of this
        file caught that catching `pydantic.ValidationError` broadly *around the service call*
        conflates two very different things. `ArchitectureIntelligenceService.get_service_dependencies`
        documents that a malformed *caller-supplied* context value raises `ValidationError` - safe to
        echo back, it only describes the caller's own field/value. But `SnapshotRef`,
        `DependencyClaim`/`EntityRef`, `ServiceDependenciesData`, and the final `ArchitectureAnswer`
        are *also* Pydantic models, constructed from real graph data *after* that point - a
        (hypothetical, bug-indicating) `ValidationError` from any of those would carry a Pydantic
        `input_value` built from internal graph/output data, and passing that error's `str()` through
        to the client the same way would defeat the SDK's own sanitization for exactly the class of
        failure it exists to catch (spec §15/§20's "raw ... values outside the public contract are
        never returned"). Pre-validating here means the service call below is never wrapped in a
        `pydantic.ValidationError` handler at all: if a `ValidationError` somehow still escapes the
        service (it shouldn't, once the context is already known-valid), it is *supposed* to fall
        through uncaught into the SDK's own generic sanitization - see the next paragraph.

        Confirmed live (`mcp.server.mcpserver.tools.base.Tool.run`) that the SDK itself already
        sanitizes any uncaught tool-body exception (this one included) into
        `UnexpectedToolError("Error executing tool get_service_dependencies")` - by design, never
        interpolating `str(exc)` - and separately logs the real exception and traceback server-side
        (`mcp.server.mcpserver.server._handle_call_tool`'s `logger.exception(...)`). That already
        satisfies spec §16's "Unexpected internal/driver failure -> Sanitized tool execution error"
        row and the same release blocker with no adapter code needed for that class of failure.

        Every other outcome (`ANSWERED`/`PARTIAL`/`NOT_ANSWERED`, including a
        `SNAPSHOT_NOT_AVAILABLE`/`UNKNOWN_ENTITY`/etc. refusal) is a normal *returned*
        `ArchitectureAnswer`, never an exception - the SDK's default "no exception raised" path
        already gives `isError: false` for those, satisfying spec §10 rule 5 with no code needed
        here.
