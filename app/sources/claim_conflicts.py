"""Cross-source content-conflict detection for shared/explicitly-mapped Schema and Message ids.

I1 spec §8.1: "Two current owners explicitly mapped to one shared Schema ID with different
canonical hashes are REJECTED_CONFLICT." §9.1's message equivalent: "different contract digests
under the same explicit shared ID conflict." Two independent sources' claims only become
comparable once collected together - `app.ingestion._shared.upsert_schema_or_conflict`/
`upsert_message_or_conflict` catch the *within one source* case at the point of insertion (their
model already deduped by the time it's returned); this module catches the *across sources* case,
fed the same list of per-source models the orchestrator is about to merge, before `merge_models`'s
own first-wins dedup discards the disagreement.
