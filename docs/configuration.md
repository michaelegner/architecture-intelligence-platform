# Configuration

All installation-dependent values are controllable via `config.yaml` or environment variables —
nothing installation-specific is hardcoded. `config.yaml` (repo root) follows the shape
`app/settings.py::load_config` reads under a single top-level `architecture_intelligence:` key.

## Secrets — environment only, never `config.yaml`

`app/settings.py::load_secrets` reads these from the environment and only the environment:

| Variable | Required | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `NEO4J_USER` | no | `neo4j` |
| `NEO4J_PASSWORD` | **yes** | — (raises `RuntimeError` if unset) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | no | `None` — the LLM query layer is disabled without it, everything else works |
| `NEO4J_URI` | no | overrides `graph.uri` from `config.yaml` if set (matches `docker-compose.yml`) |

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill these in for local development.

## `config.yaml` sections

| Section | Fields (defaults) |
|---|---|
| `sources` | `directories` (`["./repositories"]`) — where to scan for OpenAPI/AsyncAPI/manifest files |
| `graph` | `uri` (`bolt://localhost:7687`), `database` (`neo4j`), `max_traversal_depth` (`5`) |
| `import` | `openapi`, `asyncapi`, `architecture_manifest` — each `true`, toggles that adapter |
| `llm` | `enabled` (`true`), `max_result_rows` (`100`) — `enabled: false` (or a missing API key) fully disables the LLM query layer with no other effect |
| `intent_router` | `deterministic_threshold` (`0.90`) — confidence threshold above which a question is routed to a deterministic analysis instead of the LLM |
| `telemetry.service_aliases` / `queue_aliases` | `{}` — map an observed name to its declared canonical name when they differ |
| `telemetry.http-correlation` | `enabled` (`true`), `ttl-seconds` (`60`), `max-pending-spans` (`10000`) — the cross-batch correlation buffer's bounds (11H-B) |
| `telemetry.coverage` | `qualification-enabled` (`true`) — the O4 coverage-classification kill switch (11H-E) |
| `runtime_analysis` | `default_window_hours` (`24`), `default_environment` (`production`) |

## Complete worked example

The following is the repository's current `config.yaml`, annotated so each section can be copied
and adjusted without reconstructing it from the reference table above:

```yaml
# All application configuration lives under this single top-level key.
architecture_intelligence:
  # Directories scanned for declared architecture sources.
  sources:
    directories:
      - examples

  # Neo4j connection and graph traversal settings.
  graph:
    uri: bolt://localhost:7687
    database: neo4j
    max_traversal_depth: 5

  # Enable or disable each declared-source ingestion adapter.
  import:
    openapi: true
    asyncapi: true
    architecture_manifest: true

  # Optional LLM query layer and its maximum result size.
  llm:
    enabled: true
    max_result_rows: 100

  # Confidence threshold for deterministic routing before LLM fallback.
  intent_router:
    deterministic_threshold: 0.9

  # Runtime telemetry name mapping, correlation, and coverage classification.
  telemetry:
    service_aliases: {}
    queue_aliases: {}

    # Bounds for correlating HTTP spans that arrive in different batches.
    http-correlation:
      enabled: true
      ttl-seconds: 60
      max-pending-spans: 10000

    # Enable runtime coverage qualification.
    coverage:
      qualification-enabled: true

  # Defaults used when runtime-analysis requests omit a window or environment.
  runtime_analysis:
    default_window_hours: 24
    default_environment: production
```

Keep credentials out of this file. `NEO4J_USER`, `NEO4J_PASSWORD`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and the
optional `NEO4J_URI` override belong in the environment as described above.

## Backward compatibility guarantee

Every 11H-era property (`telemetry.http-correlation.*`, `telemetry.coverage.*`) is optional with a
safe default — an existing `config.yaml` written before these properties existed still starts the
app completely unchanged. This isn't just convention: `HttpCorrelationConfig` and `CoverageConfig`
are both plain Pydantic models with `Field(default=...)` on every property, and `TelemetryConfig`
constructs them via `default_factory` when the whole section is absent — there's no code path where
a missing 11H property prevents startup.

## LLM stays fully optional

The platform works completely without any LLM provider configured. `app/main.py` sets
`app.state.llm_provider = None` whenever `llm.enabled` is false or `OPENAI_API_KEY` is unset —
`POST /api/query` still answers every deterministically-routed question exactly as before; only a
genuinely unrecognized question, which would otherwise fall through to LLM-generated Cypher, returns
a `503` explaining the LLM subsystem isn't configured. See
[`semantic-validation.md`](semantic-validation.md) for the full generated-Cypher pipeline this only
gates the entry to.
