# Architecture

Architecture Intelligence Platform (AIP) is a modular Python monolith (a single FastAPI process);
Neo4j is its only external persistent infrastructure dependency. It builds an **Architecture
Knowledge Graph** by ingesting OpenAPI/AsyncAPI/manifest documents (declared architecture) and,
optionally, OpenTelemetry traces (observed architecture), and answers questions about it either
through fixed, deterministic Cypher analyses or a read-only natural-language query layer.

## Ingestion pipeline

The pipeline is strictly staged, and each stage must fully succeed before the next runs:

```
scan -> parse -> source-level validate -> map to Canonical Model -> canonical validate
     -> reconcile/diff -> transactional graph write
```

`app/ingestion/orchestrator.py` drives discovery, mapping, and merge, via a registered
`SourceAdapter` seam (`app/sources/registry.py` — see [ADR 0009](adr/0009-source-adapter-seam.md));
`app/graph/importer.py` drives reconciliation and the write. A source's import is **atomic**: it
either fully succeeds or is entirely discarded — a partial import is never left in the graph (this
is validation rule V9 / acceptance criterion AC14 of the original PoC spec, now scoped per source
instance rather than per service — one service may be declared by more than one source, and one
source may declare more than one service). Per-source reimport is MERGE-based and idempotent:
importing the same source twice produces the same graph state, and a relation that's still
supported by evidence from another declaring source is never wrongly deleted (see
[`evidence.md`](evidence.md) and [`graph-model.md`](graph-model.md) for the exact invariant this
guarantees).

Source adapters never write directly to Neo4j. Each adapter first maps its input into a shared
**Canonical Model** ([`canonical-model.md`](canonical-model.md)), decoupling parsers, graph
persistence, and different data sources from one another — see
[`adapter-development.md`](adapter-development.md) for what a new adapter needs to produce.

## Runtime observation pipeline

Independently of declared ingestion, `POST /v1/traces` accepts OpenTelemetry OTLP/HTTP trace
exports, resolves them against whatever is already declared in the graph, and persists observed
facts/evidence alongside the declared ones — see [`opentelemetry.md`](opentelemetry.md) for the
full contract.

## API surface

Every endpoint is mounted in `app/main.py`; each router lives in its own `app/api/*.py` module:

| Router | Prefix | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| `services.py` | `/api/services` | List/get services; per-service evidence |
| `queues.py` | `/api/queues` | List/get queues; per-queue evidence |
| `messages.py` | `/api/messages` | List/get messages |
| `architecture_intelligence.py` | `/api/services/{id}/dependencies`, `/api/services/{id}/drift` | REST parity for `ArchitectureIntelligenceService.get_service_dependencies`/`.get_architecture_drift` (v0.5.0 I3 slice 5a) |
| `evidence.py` | `/api/evidence` | `POST /resolve` (REST parity for `ArchitectureIntelligenceService.get_evidence`); snapshot-aware `GET ""`/`GET /{id}` convenience list/lookup over publicly visible `Evidence` nodes |
| `analysis.py` | `/api/analysis` | Deterministic A1-A5 (senders/consumers/orphan-queue/blast-radius) |
| `runtime.py` (`runtime_router`) | `/api/runtime` | Observed relations, per-service runtime profile |
| `runtime.py` (`runtime_analysis_router`) | `/api/analysis/runtime` | O1-O5 (confirmed/observed-only/declared-only/coverage) |
| `import_api.py` | `/api/import` | Trigger a full or per-service (re)import from configured source directories |
| `query.py` | `/api/query` | Natural-language question -> deterministic analysis or validated read-only Cypher |
| `telemetry.py` | `/v1/traces` | OTLP/HTTP trace ingestion |
| `ui.py` | `/`, `/services/{id}`, `/queues/{id}`, `/query` | Minimal server-rendered HTML UI |

Since `v0.5.0` I3 (ADR 0016), `ArchitectureIntelligenceService` is the single semantic owner of
public Architecture Knowledge (dependencies, drift, evidence resolution). `architecture_intelligence.py`
and `evidence.py`'s `POST /resolve` are thin REST wrappers over that service — they construct the
existing request model and call the corresponding service method exactly once, never querying Neo4j
or re-deriving Architecture Knowledge independently. Standard negotiated [MCP](mcp.md) is the other
public adapter over the same service; the two are semantically equivalent for equivalent requests.
The remaining routers above predate this consolidation and expose general graph-browsing/analysis
capability, not `ArchitectureIntelligenceService`'s own contract.

See [`analyses.md`](analyses.md) for what each deterministic analysis actually computes,
[`semantic-validation.md`](semantic-validation.md) for the NL-query pipeline,
[`mcp.md`](mcp.md) for the MCP adapter, and [`configuration.md`](configuration.md) for every setting
that shapes this behavior.

## Architecture principles

Six principles this codebase is built on, each with the reasoning and consequences behind it
recorded as an Architecture Decision Record under [`adr/`](adr/):

1. Canonical model before backend-specific persistence — [ADR 0002](adr/0002-canonical-model.md)
   (and [ADR 0001](adr/0001-use-neo4j.md) for why Neo4j is that backend).
2. Evidence before assertion — [ADR 0003](adr/0003-evidence-as-first-class-concept.md).
3. Deterministic before generative — [ADR 0004](adr/0004-deterministic-before-generative.md).
4. LLM output is untrusted — [ADR 0005](adr/0005-llm-is-not-source-of-truth.md).
5. Declared and observed architecture are independent evidence sources —
   [ADR 0006](adr/0006-declared-vs-observed.md) (and
   [ADR 0007](adr/0007-do-not-store-full-traces-in-neo4j.md) for the related rule that runtime
   observation never means storing raw traces).
6. The open-source core must work without a commercial API — see
   [`configuration.md`](configuration.md)'s LLM-optional guarantee, a direct consequence of
   principle 3.
