# Evidence & Provenance

Every architecture fact — every `Relation` in the Canonical Model, every relation in the graph —
must carry provenance. `Provenance` (`app/provenance/model.py`) is the base shape:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | Deterministic id (see [`canonical-model.md`](canonical-model.md)) |
| `source_type` | `OPENAPI` \| `ASYNCAPI` \| `MANIFEST` \| `OPENTELEMETRY` |
| `source_file` | Where this came from (a spec file path, or `opentelemetry` for observed evidence) |
| `source_revision` | Optional — a git revision or similar, if known |
| `evidence_type` | `DECLARED` \| `OBSERVED` (`INFERRED` is reserved for a future documents/LLM/rules-derived phase and is not populated by anything today) |

`ObservedEvidence` extends `Provenance` with the fields a runtime observation needs: `environment`,
`bucket_start`/`bucket_end` (a one-day bucket), `first_seen`/`last_seen`, `observation_count`,
`sample_trace_ids` (capped at 5), `service_version`, and `correlation_mode` (below).

## The `Evidence` node

`Evidence` is its own Neo4j node label, queryable via `GET /api/evidence`, `GET /api/evidence/{id}`,
`GET /api/services/{id}/evidence`, `GET /api/queues/{id}/evidence`. There is no direct graph edge
from a relation to the `Evidence` node(s) that back it — every relation instead carries an
`evidence_ids: list[str]` property naming them; look them up with
`MATCH (e:Evidence) WHERE e.id IN r.evidence_ids`. This is what makes provenance fully traceable
end-to-end, not just produced in-memory during ingestion and discarded.

## Worked fixture example

After importing the bundled `examples/` fixtures, the declared `CALLS` relation from
`service:order-service` to ProductService's `GET /products/{id}` operation carries this concrete
provenance reference:

```json
{
  "evidence_ids": ["evidence:manifest:order-service"]
}
```

That id can be resolved through the evidence API:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/evidence/evidence:manifest:order-service
```

For the repository's default fixture import, the response is:

```json
{
  "id": "evidence:manifest:order-service",
  "source_type": "MANIFEST",
  "source_file": "examples/order-service/architecture.yaml",
  "source_revision": null,
  "evidence_type": "DECLARED"
}
```

The same relation-to-evidence lookup can be performed directly in Neo4j. This follows the
`evidence_ids` property rather than a graph edge to `Evidence`:

```cypher
MATCH (:Service {id: 'service:order-service'})-[r:CALLS]->(:Operation) MATCH (e:Evidence) WHERE e.id IN r.evidence_ids RETURN r.evidence_ids AS evidence_ids, e.id AS id, e.source_type AS source_type, e.source_file AS source_file, e.evidence_type AS evidence_type;
```

For this fixture, `r.evidence_ids` is `["evidence:manifest:order-service"]`, so the query resolves the
same manifest-backed `Evidence` node returned by the API. `GET /api/services/service:order-service/evidence`
can be used when you want all evidence backing relations incident to OrderService rather than one
specific evidence id.

## `correlation_mode`

For `OBSERVED` evidence produced by the OpenTelemetry pipeline, `correlation_mode` records *how*
the observation was correlated (`app/telemetry/model.py::CorrelationMode`):

- `CLIENT_SERVER` — the strongest signal: a matched CLIENT+SERVER span pair, whether they arrived
  in the same OTLP batch or were matched across two separate batches via the correlation buffer.
- `CLIENT_ONLY` — a CLIENT span whose target service identity is stable (`peer.service`) but whose
  SERVER counterpart never arrived (partial instrumentation).
- `SERVER_ONLY` — a SERVER span whose caller was never identifiable — this never produces a `CALLS`
  fact on its own (see [`opentelemetry.md`](opentelemetry.md)); it's recorded as an unresolved
  observation, not guessed.
- `MESSAGING_SEND` / `MESSAGING_RECEIVE` / `MESSAGING_PROCESS` — messaging spans, which never need
  correlation (each is independently derivable), but still record which of the three operation
  kinds produced the evidence.

When two observation seeds land in the same evidence bucket, the merge keeps the *stronger* of the
two modes (`app/telemetry/aggregator.py::merge_evidence`) — `CLIENT_SERVER` outranks
`CLIENT_ONLY`/`SERVER_ONLY`, which outrank the `MESSAGING_*` modes, which outrank no mode at all.

## Declared vs. observed, and why both matter

`DECLARED` evidence comes from a spec (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI) or the architecture manifest — it says
"this is the intended architecture." `OBSERVED` evidence comes from real OpenTelemetry traffic — it
says "this actually happened." A fact can carry either, both, or (for a moment, during a stale
reimport) transition between them; see [`graph-model.md`](graph-model.md) for the exact
reconciliation invariants this produces and why a fact is never deleted while any evidence, of
either kind, still supports it.
