# /aip:inspect

Inspect one service with AIP and print what it returns. Read-only: never edit files or run commands.

Requested service: `$ARGUMENTS`

1. **Subject.** If an argument is given, it is the service (a name or an id from the table below). Otherwise
   infer it from the session: the service folder you are working in, the files touched, or the last prompt. If
   you cannot tell, ask which service; do not guess.
2. **Context.** Use the environment and window the user or the demo prompt named (whole UTC days wholly in the
   past). If none was named, ask for them; never invent them.
3. **Ask.** Call `get_service_dependencies` for the service id. A receiving service has no receiver-side
   question: if it is a receiver, say so and offer to inspect the publisher that feeds it (the publishers are in
   the table).
4. **Print** one table, one row per dependency claim: receiver (`object`), queue (`delivery.subscription`),
   destination resolution, the claim's qualification (the publisher's) and coverage, whether the **route**
   carries observed evidence (read it from `resolution_evidence_refs`: declared, observed, or both; the
   claim's own `evidence_refs` are the publisher's and say nothing about the receiver), and the evidence
   reference ids; then the snapshot id, the observation context, the Broker
   claim, and every limitation verbatim. State plainly: receipt is per messaging destination (the exchange),
   never per event type; AIP holds no payload or field-level knowledge.
5. **Drill-down on request only.** If asked to resolve references, call `get_evidence` at the answer's own
   snapshot; on `SNAPSHOT_NOT_AVAILABLE` ask the dependency question again for the same context and retry, at
   most three attempts, then report the drill-down as failed.
