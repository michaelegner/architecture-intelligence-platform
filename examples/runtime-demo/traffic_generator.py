"""Synthetic OTLP/HTTP traffic generator for the 11H-F Runtime Demo (spec §9).

This PoC's `examples/` fixture services are OpenAPI/AsyncAPI *documents*, not runnable
applications (see repository root CLAUDE.md - standing up real network services for a demo is
explicitly out of scope). This script plays the role of "Demo Services" in the topology diagram
by emitting the same realistic CLIENT/SERVER and messaging spans those services would produce if
they were real and instrumented, directly to an OTel Collector's OTLP/HTTP receiver - proving the
"Demo Services -> OTel Collector -> AIP" forwarding path end-to-end without requiring real HTTP
traffic between real processes.

Builds the same declared topology as `examples/`: order-service calls product-service's
GET /products/{id}, order-service sends to payment-q, payment-service receives payment-q and
sends invoice-q. Uses only `opentelemetry-proto` (already a project dependency, used identically
by AIP's own decoder and this repo's test suite) - no OpenTelemetry SDK, no extra dependencies.

Before sending any traffic, this script blocks until `order-service` shows up as a *declared*
Service in AIP's graph (`wait_for_declared_import`) - i.e. until `POST /api/import` has actually
run. Sending observed spans for "OrderService" before that import exists would make AIP's exact-
name service resolver (`app/telemetry/service_resolver.py`) mint its own observed-only Service
node for the name; the later `POST /api/import` then creates a *second*, differently-ID'd Service
node with the same declared name, and the two never merge (the resolver's tier-2 name match only
fires when the name is unique across all Service nodes) - permanently splitting "OrderService"'s
declared and observed identities. Waiting removes that race instead of just documenting it.

Two extra behaviors exist purely to make the H5 demo (spec §14-15) self-demonstrating rather than
requiring a contrived side scenario:

- Every cycle additionally emits an OrderService -> LegacyPricingService CLIENT/SERVER pair
  (spec §14's "Zusätzlich H4" topology addendum). LegacyPricingService is never declared anywhere
  in `examples/` or its OpenAPI/manifest, so this call surfaces as `OBSERVED_ONLY` - a live,
  undocumented-dependency finding, not just a described one.
- Every `CROSS_BATCH_EVERY_N`-th cycle, the OrderService -> ProductService CLIENT and SERVER spans
  are additionally sent as two separate OTLP export requests a few seconds apart (see
  `send_cross_batch_pair`), instead of bundled in one request - demonstrating the optional
  cross-batch HTTP correlation scenario from spec §15's last paragraph. This is additive: the
  regular bundled pair each cycle already keeps the relation `CONFIRMED` on its own.

See `examples/runtime-demo/README.md` for the full walkthrough, including the NOT_OBSERVED_IN_WINDOW
and 11H reconciliation scenarios (which are timing/reimport-driven, not something this generator
itself needs to produce).
