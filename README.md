Build an evidence-backed model of your software architecture from declared and observed signals —
with the evidence behind every architectural claim.

[Evaluation](#deterministic-evaluation) · [Documentation](#documentation) · [Research Landscape](landscape.md)**

## Why?

Hand-maintained architecture documentation tends to drift from the system it describes. AIP builds its
knowledge graph automatically from artifacts that already exist and are already kept up to date as
part of normal development — OpenAPI/AsyncAPI specs, a minimal manifest for the one thing they can't
express (who calls what), and, optionally, real OpenTelemetry traffic — so every fact in the graph
traces back to real evidence, never to a stale diagram someone forgot to update.

## What makes AIP different?

Traditional architecture documentation describes what a system is supposed to look like. AIP keeps
declared architecture and runtime observations together, and preserves the evidence behind each
fact:

| Evidence state | Status |
|---|---|
| `DECLARED` + `OBSERVED` | `CONFIRMED` — the documented relationship is also seen at runtime |
| `OBSERVED` only | `OBSERVED_ONLY` — a real dependency exists but was never declared |
| `DECLARED` only | `NOT_OBSERVED_IN_WINDOW` — declared, but not seen in this environment/time window |

That's the core idea: not just what the architecture says, but what the system actually does, and
why AIP believes each relationship exists. See [Declared vs Observed](#declared-vs-observed) below
for the full semantics.

## Quick Start

Requires Docker and Docker Compose (Python 3.13 only if you want to run it outside a container):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/michaelegner/architecture-intelligence-platform.git
cd architecture-intelligence-platform
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up
```

`.env.example`'s `NEO4J_PASSWORD` is a fixed local-only default (`change-me-local`) — fine for
trying this out, never for anything reachable outside your machine.

Then open <http://localhost:8000>. `config.yaml` already points at this repo's `examples/` fixture
services, so `POST /api/import` works immediately against them. See
[`docs/development.md`](docs/development.md) for running locally without Docker, the test suite, and
linting.

After importing the bundled example, open the Service Explorer to inspect the architecture graph.
For the full declared-vs-observed experience — `CONFIRMED`, `OBSERVED_ONLY`, and
`NOT_OBSERVED_IN_WINDOW` relations, not just declared ones — run the
[runtime demo](#runtime-demo) below; it adds synthetic OpenTelemetry traffic on top of the same
fixture.

## What you'll see

AIP shows declared and observed architecture side by side. In the bundled runtime demo:

- `OrderService -> ProductService` is `CONFIRMED` — declared and observed.
- `OrderService -> LegacyPricingService` is `OBSERVED_ONLY` — a real dependency the manifest never
  declared.
- `unused-q` is `NOT_OBSERVED_IN_WINDOW` — declared, but not observed in this environment/time
  window.

![Service Explorer showing OrderService's declared vs. observed dependencies: ProductService and
payment-q are CONFIRMED, LegacyPricingService is OBSERVED_ONLY, and unused-q is
NOT_OBSERVED_IN_WINDOW.](images/runtime-demo-drift.png)

See the [runtime demo](#runtime-demo) for the full walkthrough, or
[`examples/runtime-demo/README.md`](examples/runtime-demo/README.md) directly.

## Features

**Ingestion**
- ✓ OpenAPI ingestion
- ✓ AsyncAPI queue topology
- ✓ Architecture manifest support (the one place declared REST *callers* come from)
- ✓ Evidence / provenance on every fact, independently for declared and observed evidence

**Graph & analysis**
- ✓ Neo4j architecture knowledge graph
- ✓ Deterministic dependency analyses (queue senders/consumers, orphan queues)
- ✓ Architecture blast radius (mixed sync + async traversal)
- ✓ Semantic Cypher validation (a hard allowlist gate, not an LLM guardrail)
- ✓ Natural-language architecture queries — deterministic where possible, validated read-only Cypher otherwise

**Runtime telemetry (OpenTelemetry)**
- ✓ Runtime discovery of undeclared operations, services and queues
- ✓ Cross-batch HTTP correlation (a CLIENT and SERVER span arriving in separate OTLP requests still
  correlate to one observed dependency)
- ✓ Partial-instrumentation tolerance (a stable one-sided observation still counts, an unreliable one
  never gets guessed)
- ✓ Declared vs. observed architecture, and architecture drift detection
- ✓ Telemetry coverage qualification for negative findings

See [`docs/opentelemetry.md`](docs/opentelemetry.md) for what the `CLIENT_SERVER`/`CLIENT_ONLY`/
`SERVER_ONLY`/`UNRESOLVED` correlation modes above actually mean.

## Declared vs Observed

Every relation in the graph carries evidence, and its evidence can be `DECLARED` (from a spec/
manifest), `OBSERVED` (from real telemetry), or both. That's what turns into a status:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `CONFIRMED` | Declared **and** observed |
| `OBSERVED_ONLY` | Observed, but never declared anywhere — an undocumented real dependency |
| `NOT_OBSERVED_IN_WINDOW` | Declared, but not seen in this window — never "obsolete"/"unused"/"dead", just not observed *yet or here* |

Removing a stale declaration never deletes a relation that still has observed evidence — it degrades
`CONFIRMED` to `OBSERVED_ONLY` instead. See [`docs/graph-model.md`](docs/graph-model.md) for the
exact invariant this guarantees and why it matters.

## Example

The bundled `examples/` fixture is a small, fully synthetic four-service landscape:

![Example topology: OrderService calls ProductService over REST and sends to payment-q, which PaymentService receives from and sends to invoice-q, which InvoiceService receives from.](images/example-topology-light.svg#gh-light-mode-only)
![Example topology: OrderService calls ProductService over REST and sends to payment-q, which PaymentService receives from and sends to invoice-q, which InvoiceService receives from.](images/example-topology-dark.svg#gh-dark-mode-only)

`unused-q` (a sender with no consumer) and `unknown-producer-q` (a consumer with no known sender) are
included specifically to exercise the orphan-queue analyses. `POST /api/import` loads all of it in
one call.

## Architecture

A modular Python monolith (a single FastAPI process); Neo4j is the only external persistent
dependency. Ingestion is a strictly staged pipeline — `scan -> parse -> source-validate -> map to
canonical model -> canonical-validate -> reconcile/diff -> transactional graph write` — where a
service's import either fully succeeds or is entirely discarded, never left partial. Source adapters
never write to Neo4j directly; they all map into one shared Canonical Model first. Full details,
including the graph/evidence model and every API route: [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

## Deterministic Analyses

Five fixed, parameterized Cypher analyses over declared architecture (queue senders/consumers,
orphan queues, mixed-architecture blast radius) plus five over declared-vs-observed runtime data
(what was actually observed, what's confirmed, what's observed-only, what's declared-only, and
per-service telemetry coverage). None of these involve the LLM — see
[`docs/analyses.md`](docs/analyses.md) for the full list and what each one answers.

## Deterministic Evaluation

A ten-scenario evaluation suite proves the declared/observed architecture intelligence above
against independently authored ground truth — real AIP ingestion and runtime resolution, compared
against a hand-written `expected.yaml`, with deterministic PASS/FAIL:

```bash
uv run python -m evaluation run
```

No LLM provider key is required — this suite never touches the natural-language query layer. See
[`evaluation/README.md`](evaluation/README.md) for the full scenario list, ground-truth format, and
failure-report examples.

## OpenTelemetry

`POST /v1/traces` is AIP's OTLP/HTTP ingestion boundary. It resolves incoming spans against whatever
is already declared in the graph and persists observed facts and evidence alongside the declared
ones — never inventing a fact it can't trace back to real telemetry.

**AIP is an additional telemetry consumer, not the primary observability backend.** It must never be
the only thing an OTel Collector forwards to, and its own availability must never affect an
application's normal observability:

![Applications send to an OTel Collector, which forwards in parallel to a primary observability backend and, separately, to Architecture Intelligence Platform.](images/otel-fanout-light.svg#gh-light-mode-only)
![Applications send to an OTel Collector, which forwards in parallel to a primary observability backend and, separately, to Architecture Intelligence Platform.](images/otel-fanout-dark.svg#gh-dark-mode-only)

Failure isolation, buffering, and retry behavior belong in the Collector/deployment configuration —
`/v1/traces` does no buffering or retry of its own, by design. Full attribute allowlist, correlation
modes, and coverage-qualification model: [`docs/opentelemetry.md`](docs/opentelemetry.md).

### Runtime demo

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml up --build
```

Brings up `architecture-intelligence` + `neo4j` (as above) plus an `otel-collector` service and a
`traffic-generator` that emits realistic synthetic OTLP traces for the `examples/` fixture topology
every few seconds (see `examples/runtime-demo/traffic_generator.py`'s docstring for why this repo
generates spans directly rather than running real HTTP services). The Collector forwards every batch
to AIP's `/v1/traces` and, in parallel, to a `debug` exporter — standing in for "an additional
tracing backend" in the topology above.

Once it's running, `POST /api/import` to declare the fixture topology, then watch
`GET /api/runtime/relations?environment=demo` fill in with `OBSERVED`/`CONFIRMED` relations as the
generator's traffic lands — a live demonstration of the `DECLARED + OBSERVED -> CONFIRMED` and, on a
later reimport with a declaration removed, `-> OBSERVED_ONLY` transition described above. The
generator also emits an undeclared `OrderService -> LegacyPricingService` call (surfacing as
`OBSERVED_ONLY` on its own, with no reimport needed) and periodically splits one CLIENT/SERVER pair
across two OTLP requests to demonstrate cross-batch correlation. The same states are also visible in
the web UI at <http://localhost:8000/> — the Service Explorer shows declared vs. observed side by
side, and <http://localhost:8000/query> answers questions like "Which dependencies are observed but
undocumented?" without needing an LLM configured. See
[`examples/runtime-demo/README.md`](examples/runtime-demo/README.md) for the full step-by-step
walkthrough — every state (`CONFIRMED`, `OBSERVED_ONLY`, `NOT_OBSERVED_IN_WINDOW`) and the
reconciliation scenario, each with exact `curl` commands and expected results.

The Service Explorer shows the same declared-vs-observed states illustrated in
[What you'll see](#what-youll-see), while the walkthrough above explains how each state is produced.

## Natural Language Queries

`POST /api/query` answers a plain-language question either by routing it to an existing
deterministic analysis (above) or, if it doesn't recognize the question, by generating Cypher that
must pass a strict read-only allowlist validator before it ever touches Neo4j. The LLM never holds
write credentials and its Cypher is always shown back alongside the answer for traceability. Fully
optional — the platform works completely without any LLM provider configured. See
[`docs/semantic-validation.md`](docs/semantic-validation.md).
