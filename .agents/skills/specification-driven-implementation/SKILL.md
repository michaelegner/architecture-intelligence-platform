name: specification-driven-implementation
description: Use when implementing or reviewing substantial work against an AIP release or increment specification (the release specification or its iN-*.md increment specs) - producing a reviewed plan before changing production code, persisting it, implementing without altering normative semantics, reconciling the result against the retained plan, and driving PR reviews to a clear approval decision. Not needed for small maintenance changes that don't touch public contracts, identity, evidence, qualification, reconciliation, or release semantics.

# Specification-driven implementation

This skill is **procedural, not normative**. It cannot override
[product doctrine](../../../docs/product-doctrine-and-strategic-direction.md),
[`ROADMAP.md`](../../../ROADMAP.md) boundaries, or any specification under
[`docs/specifications/`](../../../docs/specifications/). Where this skill and a specification
disagree, the specification wins — stop and flag the conflict rather than following this skill
past it. See [`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md) for the mandatory-behavior list this skill executes.

**Tests are evidence, not qualification.** Agent-authored tests demonstrate that an implementation
does what the plan says it does — they are implementation evidence. They are never independent
qualification of the specification itself, and passing tests can never resolve a specification
ambiguity. If the specification is ambiguous about what "correct" means here, no amount of green
tests answers that question — only a specification decision does.

**Stop on unstated semantic decisions.** If implementing the plan requires a decision the
specification doesn't state — a precedence rule, an identity formula, a conflict-resolution
outcome, an unsupported-case behavior — stop and return the decision to the specification (ask the
human, or propose a specific, disclosed specification amendment). Do not silently pick a default
and continue.

**Small-change exemption.** A maintenance change that doesn't alter public contracts, identity
rules, evidence/provenance semantics, qualification behavior, reconciliation logic, or release
semantics does not need this full workflow. When genuinely uncertain whether a change qualifies,
treat it as substantial and run the full workflow anyway.

**Documentation-only pre-PR validation exemption.** When the complete proposed PR diff contains only
documentation and has no source relevance, do **not** run the repository's unit/integration test
suites merely as a prerequisite to opening the PR. "No source relevance" means the change touches no
production or test source, executable examples/fixtures, schemas, configuration, workflows,
dependency/lock files, generated artifacts, version/build metadata, or other files whose contents
can change runtime, build, validation, release, or qualification behavior. Before relying on this
exemption, inspect the complete diff and state why it is documentation-only. Run only lightweight
validation that can provide signal for the changed documents (for example Markdown/link/reference
checks when such tooling exists). Once the PR exists, normal CI remains authoritative and may still
run repository-wide tests. If any changed file has plausible source/runtime/build/qualification
relevance, the exemption does not apply.

## Planning-start telemetry

For every substantial workflow that uses this skill, record one immutable planning-start timestamp
before phase 1 begins.

1. Capture the current time once, in UTC, as RFC 3339 / ISO 8601 with whole-second precision:
   `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`.
2. Immediately notify the human in the active interaction:
   `Planning started at <timestamp>.`
3. Keep that exact value unchanged for the lifetime of the work. Re-review, resumed sessions, plan
   revisions, implementation, and reconciliation do not reset it.
4. When the first pull request for the work is opened, add exactly one hidden machine-readable marker
   to the PR description:

   ```html
   <!-- aip-agent-metadata:v1 {"planning_started_at":"2026-09-18T20:41:12Z"} -->
   ```

   Substitute the captured timestamp; do not use the example value.
5. Preserve the marker verbatim through later PR-description edits. If a valid marker already exists, keep the earlier of the existing marker value and your captured timestamp (never overwrite an earlier value).
6. Never invent or retrospectively estimate a missing planning-start timestamp. Historical work that
   predates this convention remains uninstrumented.

The timestamp measures when the agent begins substantive specification/repository planning, not when
the PR is opened and not when the first implementation commit is created. This makes
`planning_started_at -> merged_at` computable from GitHub without changing the implementation
workflow.

Do **not** encode the timestamp in a GitHub label. Labels are repository-scoped categorical metadata,
so a timestamp label would create a new repository label for every PR and pollute the label
namespace. A single static label such as `agent-driven` MAY be used independently for filtering if
the repository adopts one, but the timestamp remains in the hidden PR metadata marker.

## The nine phases

1. **Resolve the governing specification and revision.** Identify the exact release and increment
   spec (or parent spec) this work is governed by, and its exact revision/draft marker (e.g. "Draft
   0.3, amended during PR3b — see its own §12 amendment note"). Read the product doctrine and
   `ROADMAP.md` context around it, not just the increment file in isolation.

2. **Inspect the current repository and relevant prior implementation.** Read what already exists:
   related modules, prior completion records (`iN-completion-record.md` for earlier increments in
   the same release), existing tests, existing utilities. Reuse existing patterns and functions
   before proposing new ones — a fresh module that duplicates something already in `app/` is a
   planning failure, not a stylistic choice.

3. **Identify ambiguities or conflicts before planning.** Surface anything the specification leaves
   unstated or that conflicts with product doctrine/roadmap/another spec *now*, before writing the
   plan — not mid-implementation, when a stop-and-ask costs a throwaway diff instead of a throwaway
   sentence.

4. **Produce the bounded implementation plan**, using the template below. Bounded means explicit
   non-goals, not just an explicit scope.

5. **Wait for human review before any production-code change.** The plan is not authorization to
   start; it's a draft for the human to approve, redirect, or reject.

6. **Persist the approved plan, verbatim, in the GitHub issue or the initial PR description.** This
   is the record of what was promised — it must survive independent of any later summary.

7. **Implement without changing normative semantics.** The plan bounds scope; it does not license
   reinterpreting the specification along the way. If the plan itself turns out to be wrong once
   implementation starts, that's a return to phase 3, not a silent in-flight redefinition.

8. **Execute the specified validation and qualification steps** — the plan's own "Validation
   Commands" section, run in full (this repo's real `tests/unit`/`tests/integration` suites, lint,
   format — not a hand-picked subset), **except for the documentation-only pre-PR validation
   exemption above**. For a qualifying docs-only PR, do not run unit/integration suites before PR
   creation solely to satisfy this phase; record the inspected diff and any lightweight
   documentation validation instead, then rely on normal PR CI for repository-wide checks. For all
   source-relevant changes, run autofixes (`ruff format`, `ruff check --fix`) before tests, not
   after, so the common case needs only one test run. This is not a blanket "autofixes never affect
   behavior" claim — `ruff check --fix` applies whatever rules are enabled, which can rewrite
   program text beyond formatting/import ordering, so treat that possibility as real: if an autofix
   runs *after* a test run that already passed and it changes source, rerun the affected (or full)
   suite before treating validation as final. The point is to avoid a redundant re-run for zero new
   signal, not to skip re-verifying a change that could plausibly affect behavior.

9. **Reconcile the final implementation against the *retained* original plan**, using the
   reconciliation template below. This is a diff against what was promised, not a fresh
   retrospective that quietly replaces the plan — both documents should remain visible together.

## Checking for review feedback

Before treating a "findings check" as complete — whether re-reviewing a PR or responding to
feedback on one you implemented — enumerate every comment surface, not just the first one found:
top-level PR review submissions (each reviewer's own review body, including bot reviewers like
Copilot), inline/line-level review comments, and plain issue-level PR comments. These are separate
API surfaces and separate UI sections; checking one does not surface the others. A comment from a
second reviewer (human or automated) can arrive close in time to a bot's and raise different
findings that don't overlap at all — cross-reference the full list before concluding the fixes
already made cover everything raised, not just the first source checked.

A single check of these surfaces is only a snapshot: a bot review and a human review can land
close together but asynchronously, so a query run right after one review lands can genuinely
return nothing for a slower reviewer that posts moments later — not because it was skipped, but
because it hadn't landed yet. Re-check all comment surfaces again once a fix is pushed and before
declaring the round closed, rather than trusting the enumeration taken at the start of the round.

## PR review convergence

For a specification-governed PR review, make the first substantive review as complete and
acceptance-oriented as the available evidence permits. Include the reviewed head SHA and consolidate
all known material blockers in one comment. For each blocker, cite the governing requirement, point
to concrete implementation evidence, state the required outcome without unnecessarily prescribing
the implementation, and identify the regression test or qualification evidence needed. End with an
explicit approval condition.

Re-reviews are limited to:

- resolving the recorded blockers;
- checking the requested evidence and CI; and
- identifying material correctness, security, interoperability, release-validity, or explicit-gate
  regressions introduced by the fixes.

Maintain a clear disposition of prior blockers, distinguish genuinely new blockers from unresolved
ones, and explain why any new blocker was not reasonably identifiable earlier. Do not extend the
review with cosmetic, procedural, or merely preferable changes; record worthwhile out-of-scope work
separately. Once the blocker list is empty and required evidence is green, approve or explicitly
report no blocking findings.

Use this compact comment shape when useful:

```markdown
**Review of head `<sha>`**

Previous blockers: <resolved/remaining summary>.
New blockers: <none, or material findings with governing requirement and evidence>.
Required evidence: <tests, qualification, and CI>.

**Exit condition:** <specific conditions after which the PR will be approved, unless their fixes
introduce a material regression>.
```

## Reconciliation template

```markdown
## Completed As Planned

## Deviations & Justification
<what changed from the plan, and why>

## Specification Questions Discovered
<any ambiguity or gap surfaced during implementation, and how it was resolved (or that it's still
open)>

## Deferred Work
<what was explicitly out of scope or pushed to a later increment>

## Test/Qualification Evidence
<the actual validation-command results, e.g. exact pass counts>

## Remaining Limitations
<what this implementation does not cover, disclosed rather than silently omitted>
